# ABREE Web Proxy

Abree Web Proxy is a lightweight and secure web proxy service that allows users to search the web privately and securely. This project combines the power of ASP.NET Core (C#) for backend operations, Flask (Python) for additional processing, and modern HTML/CSS for a professional front-end design. The proxy is designed to fetch and display search results anonymously, ensuring user privacy.
